# EarthDimension404
This project was developed to create an apk which would serve as the basis for a question in a CTF event held by us, the final year students of BIT Mesra 2k14-18 batch to encourage interest in security areas for our juniors. 

The aim of this question was to teach about opening android apk and converting .dex file to .java files. Then a little bit of magic of grep, reading code and decrypting an encrypted pdf. Go ahead and solve it yourself.
